# On Hopfield Network Attractor Localization and Visualization
Project done for the course **Neural Networks (NEVR3004) at NTNU** (Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience). 

Instructions: The paper should be written independently and will cover a course topic of your choice.

## Abstract
_Hopfield networks are models of associative memory used for pattern recognition and memory retrieval from partial and noisy information. This paper focuses on the localization and visualization of attractors in Hopfield networks, examining their location, number, and network capacity. Using 2D and 3D visualizations, we explore the network’s energy landscape and its ability to store and retrieve memories. The study also analyzes the network’s dynamics, update rules, and the connection between the energy function and attractor states._
